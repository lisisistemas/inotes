#iNotes

##a simple note manager using [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) framework

In order to test the app in a browser
- install `ionic` node package globally in your system (`npm install -g ionic`)
- clone the project
- run `ionic serve` in the project library
- open `http://localhost:8100` in the browser

For the moment you can only add and remove notes. These notes are stored locally.
